# Pi Desktop

An Electron desktop application that acts as a GUI frontend for the Pi coding agent. Currently in alpha; see the Version section below.

## Version

Project is currently in **Alpha**. APIs, IPC contracts, on-disk config formats, and packaged-app behavior may all change without notice. Do not rely on anything as stable.

- Never refer to alpha releases as production-ready
- Breaking changes are acceptable before 1.0.0
- Preserve forward migration paths whenever practical

## Architecture

### Stack

- **Electron** — Desktop shell with secure IPC
- **React 19** — UI framework
- **TypeScript** — Full type safety
- **Vite** — Build tooling via electron-vite
- **TailwindCSS v4** — Styling
- **Zustand** — State management
- **Embedded Pi SDK** — `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` (exact-pinned), executed on Electron's bundled Node inside `utilityProcess.fork()` helpers via a versioned parent↔helper protocol (`src/shared/embedded-agent-protocol.ts`); no JSONL RPC, no external `pi` binary, no system Node

### Security

- `contextIsolation: true`
- `nodeIntegration: false`
- `sandbox: true`
- All IPC channels validated with typed contracts
- No renderer access to Node APIs
- Main-window navigation pinned to the packaged renderer; privileged IPC verifies the sender frame is the app renderer
- Per-workspace trust gate: an untrusted workspace's own `.pi-desktop/permission-rules.json` allow rules are ignored, its project Pi resources (settings/extensions/packages/skills) don't load, and its HTML preview runs without scripts/network, until the user trusts the workspace (one unified switch; legacy trust records require re-confirmation)
- Attachment reads limited to picked or in-workspace paths; session deletion confined to the Pi sessions dir; package specs validated before the SDK package manager runs
- The Electron utility helper is crash isolation only, NOT a security sandbox: Pi tools and loaded extensions keep the user's OS permissions

## Project Structure

Modules have colocated `*.test.ts` files (run with `npx tsx --test`).

## Features

### Embedded Pi runtime (Pi SDK)

- Pi ships as the exact-pinned `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` npm dependency, executed by Electron's own Node inside a `utilityProcess.fork()` helper per live session (`src/main/embedded-pi-worker.ts`, entry built to `out/main/embedded-pi-worker.js`). No external `pi` binary, no system Node; the build fails if Electron's bundled Node < 22.19.0 (`scripts/check-electron-node.mjs`).
- `PiSdkManager` (`src/main/pi-sdk-manager.ts`) owns one helper per session: two-phase startup (helper `ready` frame → correlated `init` response + `sessionBound`), request correlation with per-command timeouts, helper `event`/`status-change`/`exit` emissions matching the old manager's surface, and graceful shutdown (abort → dispose → bye) with `killProcessTree` escalation via the utility PID (`process-tree.ts`).
- The wire protocol lives in `src/shared/embedded-agent-protocol.ts` (versioned; every message structurally validated; SDK payloads JSON-rounded via `toTransferable` so only structured-clone-safe data crosses). Session targets: new → `SessionManager.create`, open → `open`, continue → `continueRecent`, fork → `forkFrom`, ephemeral → `inMemory`.
- The helper converts SDK events into the renderer's established event shapes (`message_update` without `partial`, toolCall blocks re-attached for toolcall_* deltas, `thinking_level_changed` → `config_update`) and mirrors the SDK RPC mode's extension UI bridge over `parentPort` (`uiRequest` messages surface as ordinary `extension_ui_request` events, so the router and dialogs are unchanged). Helper `sessionBound` messages re-map the workspace runtime to the new session file (two helpers can never write one JSONL).
- The old `PiRpcManager`, binary resolution, and `run-pi-cli.ts` are deleted. Renderer-facing IPC channels and event shapes are preserved; `piEngine`/`AgentEngineKind`/`PI_DETECT_INSTALLATIONS` and the OMP session store are removed (legacy `~/.omp` data stays untouched on disk).
- Every surface that names the agent reads `shared/agent-engine-label.ts` (now the constant "Pi"); the permission extension gets the label via `PI_DESKTOP_AGENT_LABEL`.
- Provider credentials: a lazy `EmbeddedPiAdminManager` runs a second helper mode (same worker entry, first message decides) for API-key login/logout via `ModelRuntime.login(providerId, "api_key", interaction)` and package install/remove/update via `DefaultPackageManager`. Secrets traverse one relay message and are never logged. Package ops without npm/git return a localized "optional tooling" error; without npm the session helpers set `PI_OFFLINE=1` so missing configured packages are skipped-and-diagnosed instead of auto-installed.

### Workspace Management

- Mission Control summarizes all live session runtimes and workflow runs across projects; New Task launches a prompt into a dedicated background runtime
- New Task can create or reuse an isolated Git worktree (matching task metadata, explicit branches, and GitHub PR URLs are detected), and Diff Review exposes explicit Commit → Push → PR actions with upstream-aware GitHub CLI routing
- Multiple workspaces (project directories)
- Each workspace owns a file service; every live session in that project owns an independent embedded Pi helper (utility process) bound to that workspace cwd and its own session file
- Session navigation is immediate; Pi startup and history hydration continue in the background
- Default workspace: user's home directory
- Workspace switcher in sidebar
- Auto-creates workspace when switching to a session from a different project
- **Drag-and-drop a folder** onto the window to open it as a project (create workspace if needed, switch, show Chat) — same path as File → Open Project

### Session Management

- Sessions organized by working directory (Pi native), decoded correctly cross-platform including Windows drive-letter paths
- One independent Pi runtime per live session, including multiple sessions sharing one project directory
- Switching sessions never sends a destructive `switch_session` to the previous process; the previous turn continues in the background
- Session tabs and sidebar rows show working, approval, completed, and failed indicators
- Sessions grouped by project in the session panel
- **Session tags**: type `#tag-name` in chat to tag the current session
- Tags persisted to `~/.pi-desktop-gui/session-tags.json`
- Tags displayed in session list, filterable
- Session names read from each session's `session_info` record; shown in the list and as fallback a distinguishable local timestamp (not a collapsing id prefix)
- Inline rename of the active session (double-click, or right-click → Rename…) via Pi's `set_session_name` RPC; live-updates on `session_info_changed`
- Delete uses an in-app themed confirmation dialog (not the native OS dialog, which stole window focus)
- Branch/fork tree, clone, and cross-session lineage in the Timeline; one-click context compaction (status bar + status popover)

### Chat

- Streaming responses with real-time updates
- Message editing (edit & resend)
- Conversation branching
- Copy/export messages (Markdown format), per-message copy button
- File attachments (text inlined into prompt; images sent as Pi image blocks); images can also be pasted directly into the composer
- Markdown rendering with syntax highlighting; bundled Inter/JetBrains Mono variable fonts + OpenMoji color emoji so rendering doesn't depend on system fonts
- Fenced SVG documents render as a sandboxed `data:` image with a source/render toggle (browser "secure static mode" — no scripts, no external loads)
- Filenames mentioned in chat text become clickable links that open a code/image preview pane
- Tool-call results are collapsible (first line as header, expand for the rest); edit/write results fold into the call badge with an inline diff instead of a separate pill; per-message model label
- `#tag` extraction from messages

### Model & Thinking

- Model selector dropdown in status bar, with tokenized search ("sonnet 4" matches `claude-sonnet-4`)
- `Ctrl+P` to cycle models
- Thinking level selector (off/minimal/low/medium/high/xhigh)
- Token usage and cost tracking in status bar

### Command Palette / Quick Switcher

- Open with `Ctrl/Cmd+K` (works with Pi stopped), or by typing `/` at the start of the composer
- One searchable list: commands plus Workspaces, Sessions, and Files sections; a leading `/` narrows to commands only
- Results grouped by source: Skills, Prompts, Commands (Pi built-ins), Extensions
- Skills/prompts/extensions insert their token (`/skill:name`, `/template`, `/cmd`) for Pi to expand; built-ins (`/compact`, `/clone`, `/new`, `/resume`, `/fork`, `/settings`) run the GUI action directly
- Workspace/session/file picks route through the store's guarded actions, so the streaming and dirty-editor confirms still apply

### Issue-to-PR Conveyor

- Task Launcher accepts an issue description or URL, optionally creates or reuses a local Git worktree, and sends the task to a dedicated Pi runtime. PR URLs are resolved with `gh pr view`; unrelated or ambiguous worktrees are never guessed.
- Diff Review exposes explicit Commit, Push, and PR actions; mutating Git operations never happen implicitly.
- PR creation uses GitHub CLI when available, targets the configured `upstream` remote when present, and opens the returned PR URL.

### Workspace Activity & Desktop Notifications

- Main derives aggregate per-workspace activity (working / needs approval / completed / failed) from every session runtime's Pi events — the renderer's stream state only follows the active runtime, so this ships as its own map (`workspace-activity.ts`, broadcast on `event:workspace-activity`)
- A separate session-runtime snapshot stream exposes each live session's process status, PID, activity, and active binding for per-session indicators
- Sidebar shows per-workspace dots (pulsing while working; success/error until the workspace is next viewed) alongside the existing held-prompt badges
- OS notifications (toggleable in Settings → Behavior) fire when a turn finishes, fails, or waits for approval outside the focused view; clicking one focuses the window and switches to that workspace via the renderer's guarded switch

### Diagnostics

- Sidebar → Diagnostics: Pi binary resolution (path, source, node binary, PATH), `pi --version`, per-workspace path/trust/process status, provider key classification from models.json (never evaluates secrets), permission mode + rule counts, storage paths, and recent warnings/errors from the app log
- App log: `app-log.jsonl` in the GUI data dir (ring-buffered in memory, size-capped rotation) so packaged-build errors survive for the Diagnostics view

### File & Project

- File tree with git status badges (M/A/D/R/U)
- File search by name and content
- Git branch indicator
- Git diff viewer (working and staged)

### Code Editor

- CodeMirror 6-backed editor for opening and editing project files
- Theme-aware syntax highlighting via a custom `HighlightStyle` (in `code-editor-highlight.ts`) whose token colors are CSS variables. Each app theme (see Settings) defines its own `--cm-*` palette in `index.css`, so the editor restyles when the user switches themes — no editor logic needed.
- 15+ languages: JS/TS/JSX/TSX, JSON, Markdown, HTML, CSS/SCSS/Less, Python, Rust, Go, Java, PHP, XML/SVG, SQL, YAML, C/C++/C#
- Save/Revert/Close controls with dirty-state tracking and 2s "saved" feedback
- Debounced onChange (150ms) and race-safe file switching
- Saves validated in the main process via `path.relative()` to enforce workspace boundaries

### Terminal

- Real PTY via `node-pty` in the main process, `@xterm/xterm` in the renderer
- Full ANSI/VT100 support including 256-color and true-color
- Runs the user's shell directly — independent of the Pi process
- PTY managed by `terminal-service.ts`; IPC channels relay input/output/resize

### Home / Activity Dashboard

- **Open to Home on Launch** (Settings → Behavior): when on, boot lands on the full Home launcher (stats, changed files, recent workspaces/sessions, Open Folder / New Session). When off, boot opens Chat; an empty session uses a Codex-style **center prompt** with a **project picker** under the composer (sidebar + status chrome stay)
- Home is a single info/launcher surface — there is no separate Minimal Home layout or `homeLayout` setting
- Suggested prompt chips on empty chat **fill the composer** (ready for Enter); they do not auto-send a turn
- Recent sidebar groups sessions by project folder (platform-aware path equality)
- Compact live **subagent strip** seats on the composer while subagents run
- Range-selectable (7d–1y) stats: sessions, messages, tokens, active days, current/longest streak, peak hour, per-model input/output token usage
- Persisted per-day aggregate store (`activity-stats.ts`) survives session deletion (captured before the file is removed); only aggregate numbers are stored, never prompt/response text
- Baseline-scanned on launch (non-blocking) so stats are accurate even if Home is never opened that run
- Resuming the last session or switching workspace now loads full chat history (not just session metadata)

### File Preview Panes

- Click a workspace file link (chat or file tree) to open it in a side pane: code (CodeMirror), image, or HTML (via a sandboxed `<webview>` — no Node access, isolated partition, `file://` source only). HTML preview runs scripts and network only when the workspace is trusted; an untrusted workspace gets a static preview with a "Trust workspace" banner
- Independent from the review rail; chat toolbar toggles for sidebar, review panel, and file tree

### Packages & Skills

- Browse installed packages from Pi settings
- Package catalog from pi.dev — fetched once and filtered locally per keystroke (no per-keystroke re-crawl); concurrent paged crawl with a shared in-flight promise, prefetched at launch so the tab opens instantly
- Install/remove packages via `pi install`/`pi remove`
- Skills list with source (global/project)
- Extension commands display

### System Status Popover

Click the status icon in the sidebar header to see:
- Pi Agent status, PID, model, provider, thinking level
- Context usage with progress bar
- Token count and cost
- Workspace info
- Extensions
- Skills
- MCP Servers
- Prompt Templates

### Settings

- Pi executable path
- Theme: Dark, Light, System, Nord, Gruvbox, Breeze Dark, Breeze Light, Breeze Claudius (Breeze Dark base + deep chat surface, contributed by @sumit-m) — applies immediately. **Default is `dark`** — Breeze Claudius is opt-in only, never auto-selected for new installs
- Independent UI / Terminal / Code Editor font size sliders
- Show thinking blocks, auto-scroll
- Every field (theme, permission mode, toggles, font sizes) live-previews before Save via a unified settings draft (`store.ts` `settingsDraft`); survives view switches; Save persists, Reset restores `DEFAULT_SETTINGS`
- Permission rules: user-defined allow/deny rules (glob per Pi tool) that overlay the permission modes. Deny beats allow beats mode default; deny applies in every mode. Global rules live in `<GUI data dir>/permission-rules.json`. A workspace `.pi-desktop/permission-rules.json` is gated by workspace trust: when the workspace is trusted it fully replaces the global rules; when untrusted (the default) only its deny rules apply, layered on top of the global rules, and its allow rules are ignored (a repo can tighten, never grant). Opening a workspace whose rules file contains allow rules shows a trust prompt; the editor's Global tab notes the override and the This workspace tab carries a Trust/Revoke control. Settings → Behavior edits BOTH scopes via Global | This workspace tabs: create, edit, and remove workspace rules (in-app danger confirm), Copy from global (seeds an unsaved draft from the current global list), and per-scope JSON import/export. Manual editing of either file on disk remains fully supported — switching scope tabs re-reads that file when the scope has no unsaved draft, so hand-edited rules show up without a restart. Engine: `resources/permission-rules.ts`, shared by the Pi extension (jiti relative import, mtime-cached live re-read) and the main process. The permissions extension always loads alongside Pi when present on disk, regardless of mode or whether rules currently exist, so a rules file created mid-session is enforced immediately rather than after a restart.
  - Trust posture: a workspace's `.pi-desktop/permission-rules.json` is repo content, so its allow rules take effect only after the user explicitly trusts the workspace. `trusted-workspaces.json` is versioned (`{version:2, trusted, pendingReconfirmation}`); legacy v1 array records are demoted to `pendingReconfirmation` on first read and a re-confirm prompt on the workspace's next open promotes them. Trust is the ONE unified switch: it authorizes the workspace's allow rules, its project Pi resources (`.pi/settings.json`, extensions, packages, skills — passed to the helper as `projectTrusted`), and its interactive HTML preview. Trusting/revoking restarts the workspace's live helpers so all three take effect together. Until trusted, the repo can only add deny rules — it cannot suppress ask-mode prompts. Rule globs match raw tool input strings only (no path canonicalization, no command parsing), so rules are a guardrail against accidents, not a security sandbox; the Electron helper is not an OS sandbox either.
- Custom models & providers editor — edits `~/.pi/agent/models.json` (applied on Pi restart)
- All settings persisted to `~/.pi-desktop-gui/settings.json`; defaults come from the single shared `src/shared/default-settings.ts` (used to seed the file AND for the renderer's initial/Reset values)

### Context Menu

Right-click anywhere for:
- Copy, Cut, Paste, Select All
- Message-specific: Copy Message, Export
- Code blocks: Copy Code Block, Search Selection
- Links: Open Link, Copy Link

## IPC Architecture

All communication between renderer and main goes through a typed preload bridge:

```
Renderer → preload (contextBridge) → IPC → main handlers → Pi RPC / File system
```

- 100 IPC channels, all validated (count drifts as features land — check `IPC_CHANNELS` in `src/shared/ipc-contracts.ts` for the current number rather than trusting this doc)
- Pi events forwarded from main to renderer via `webContents.send`
- Extension UI protocol supported (select, confirm, input, editor dialogs)

## Data Storage

Paths below show the legacy home-dir location for brevity; since the canonical
data-dir migration the GUI's files live under the OS app-data dir
(`<appData>/pi-desktop`, overridable via `PI_DESKTOP_USER_DATA_DIR`), with
`~/.pi-desktop-gui` kept as the legacy fallback.

| `~/.pi-desktop-gui/workspaces.json` | Workspace list and active workspace |
| `~/.pi-desktop-gui/settings.json` | App settings |
| `~/.pi-desktop-gui/session-tags.json` | Session tags |
| `~/.pi-desktop-gui/trusted-workspaces.json` | Versioned workspace trust registry (v2: `trusted` + `pendingReconfirmation`; enables allow rules, project Pi resources, and interactive HTML preview) |
| `~/.pi-desktop-gui/activity-stats.json` | Persisted per-day activity stats (aggregates only, survives session deletion) |
| `~/.pi-desktop-gui/app-log.jsonl` | Main-process app log (warnings/errors for the Diagnostics view) |
| `~/.pi/agent/sessions/` | Pi session files (organized by cwd; the only store the index reads) |
| `~/.pi/agent/settings.json` | Pi global settings (reused in place by the embedded runtime) |
| `~/.pi/agent/auth.json` | Provider credentials written by SDK API-key login |
| `~/.pi/agent/models.json` | Pi model/provider config (edited by Settings; idle helpers hot-reload) |
| `.pi/settings.json` | Pi project settings (loaded only for trusted workspaces) |
| *(legacy)* `~/.omp/agent/` | Old OMP data — never read, listed, or migrated; left untouched on disk |

## Distribution

Pi Desktop is shipped as pre-built binaries — not via npm. Agents must not attempt `npm publish`.

| Platform | Format | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Linux | AppImage | Primary supported target |
| Windows | Installer (`-setup.exe`) + portable `.exe` | Community-tested |
| macOS | `.dmg` + `.zip` (arm64) | Built via `package:mac`; unsigned/un-notarized |

Artifacts are built with `electron-builder` and published to GitHub Releases. Artifact naming: `Pi-Desktop-{version}-{os}-{arch}.{ext}`.

Cross-builds from Linux require Wine (Windows portable only). macOS builds require a Mac.

Distribution is via pre-built binaries only — never `npm publish`. The `bin/pi-desktop.js` entry and `install.sh` are launch/install helpers, not an npm package surface.

## Development

```bash
npm install           # Install dependencies (Node >= 22.19.0 for source builds)
npm run dev           # Build and launch (reliable)
npm run dev:hot       # Dev mode with hot reload (may have race condition)
npm run build         # Build only (runs the Electron-Node gate + license manifest)
npm run preview       # Launch built app
npm run package       # Create installer
npm run verify:embedded-pi [-- --smoke]  # Verify pinned SDK + worker + resources; --smoke boots an in-memory session on Electron's Node
npm run licenses      # Regenerate resources/THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES.md
```

## Pi Integration

The Pi coding agent runs as an **embedded SDK**; one `PiSdkManager` is retained for each live session runtime, and each manager drives one Electron utility process (`utilityProcess.fork`) loading `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` (exact-pinned; see Engines above):

```
PiSdkManager --utilityProcess.fork(out/main/embedded-pi-worker.js)--> helper
helper: import SDK -> SettingsManager + ModelRuntime + DefaultResourceLoader
        -> AgentSessionRuntime (AgentSession) bound to cwd + session target
```

Communication via the versioned protocol in `src/shared/embedded-agent-protocol.ts` over `process.parentPort`:
- Parent → helper: `init`, prompt/steer/followUp, abort, model/thinking, session state/mutations, compaction, bash, `extensionUiResponse`, `reloadModelConfig`, `shutdown`
- Helper → parent: `ready`/`fatal`, correlated `response` envelopes (same shape the renderer has always received), renderer-shaped `event`s, `uiRequest`, `sessionBound`, `log`, `bye`
- Extension UI protocol (select/confirm/input/editor/notify/...) flows as `uiRequest` messages into the existing dialog router
- The renderer no longer passes arbitrary CLI arguments or `--session-dir`; session paths are authorized in main against Pi's own session store

## Versioning

Starting at `0.0.1-alpha`. Follow semantic versioning with prerelease tags:
- `0.0.x-alpha` — Alpha (current). Expect breakage in any release.
- `0.0.x-beta` — Beta. Feature-complete for the release scope; bugs expected.
- `0.0.x` — Stable patch on the 0.x track.
- `0.x.0` — Feature additions.
- `x.0.0` — Stable major release.

## Final Delivery Checklist

Before delivering a change:

1. Read the relevant existing code first
2. Reuse existing patterns and utilities
3. Implement the full solution (no placeholders or partial work)
4. Add or update tests (`npx tsx --test`)
5. Remove dead code
6. Ensure consistency (naming, API shape, structure)
7. Run `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, and `npm run build`
8. Update `MEMORY.md` when the work introduces decisions or known issues worth recording (it is a long-lived log, not a per-change requirement)
